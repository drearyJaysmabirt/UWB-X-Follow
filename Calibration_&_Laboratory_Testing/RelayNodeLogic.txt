	Description:
	
	If Vision60 received forward command from STM32 and the state of xVelocity is less than 1,
	it will increase the Counter variable by 1. 
	If the Counter variable is equal to 5, then Estop variable will be set to true and will publish "stop" to topic "/vision60_toSTM32".
	It will then stay in the while loop as the condition for the while loop is statisfied. Inside the while loop,
	it will publish "forward" to topic "/stm32_input" then an if statement will check if the state of xVelocity is more than 1,
	if the condtion is statisfied then Estop variable will be set to false and Count variable will be set to 0.
